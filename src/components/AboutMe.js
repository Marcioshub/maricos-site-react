            The world of computing is a vast field which allows us so much
            flexibility in choosing a particular field. Computers are growing at
            an un-recordable rate everyday, and they are the most influential
            tools in our lives; they are our present and future. With this
            exponential growth and excitement in the computing industry I can
            choose from many different fields that I enjoy, particularly
            Software Engineering.
